Canonical specialty -> symptom-keyword map, as provided by the project owner.
This single source of truth drives THREE things across the app:
  1. Symptom tagging in the LE-RAG evidence pipeline (rag.py)
  2. The trained department-recommendation classifier (ml/train_department_classifier.py)
  3. The specialty filter on the doctor-finder map
